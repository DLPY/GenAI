        The output should strictly adhere to the data provided, avoiding assumptions or inferences not directly supported by the numbers.
        Please print the entire report in html with tailwind styling. Please keep a clear white background and make the report
        aesthetically pleasing, yet professional. Below you will find an example of the kind of code I would like you to print out.
        Do not include any currency symbols, use 22.5M USD instead of $22.5M, display figures in millions and use thousand seperators where appropriate ie 23,100M

        Please ensure that all the figures are correctly and centrally aligned in each column of the data for the quarterly data.
        Make sure the html code only ever uses the arial font. No other font is allowed. Please ensure that the data in each
        column of the table is centrally aligned in each column. The actual report text itself should be to the left as default.
        Please also use the google blue colour for the company header. This is the font colour: #4c8bf5
        To include colours please do it like this in the html element: style="color: #4c8bf5;"
        It is also incredibly important that you make sure each report contains a table formatted as follows: <table class="w-full table-auto border border-gray-300 rounded-lg">

                      <p class="text-gray-700">
                          Tyson Foods, Inc. has experienced a significant decline in profitability across fiscal year 2023, culminating in a net loss for the year. While revenue remained relatively stable, substantial increases in the cost of sales, particularly in the Beef and Chicken segments, eroded profitability. The company has undertaken restructuring efforts and plant closures to address these challenges. From the perspective of a supplier, extending additional credit to Tyson Foods carries a heightened level of risk due to the company's recent financial performance. Further investigation is warranted to assess the long-term viability of Tyson Foods as a major customer.

                          <li class="text-gray-700"><b>Declining Profitability:</b> Tyson Foods reported a net loss of 648M USD for fiscal year 2023, a stark contrast to the 3,238M USD profit in 2022. This decline is primarily attributed to a significant increase in the cost of sales, outpacing the relatively stable revenue.</li>
                          <li class="text-gray-700"><b>Rising Cost of Sales:</b> The cost of sales increased by 7.8% from 46,614M USD in 2022 to 50,250M USD in 2023. This increase was driven by higher input costs, particularly live cattle costs in the Beef segment and feed ingredient costs in the Chicken segment.</li>
                          <li class="text-gray-700"><b>Segment Performance:</b> All segments, except Prepared Foods, experienced a decline in operating income. The Beef and Chicken segments were particularly impacted by rising input costs and challenging market conditions.</li>
                          <li class="text-gray-700"><b>Restructuring and Plant Closures:</b> Tyson Foods has implemented restructuring programs and closed several plants in the Chicken segment to address operational inefficiencies and reduce costs. These actions have resulted in significant charges in 2023.</li>
                          <li class="text-gray-700"><b>Goodwill Impairment:</b> The company recorded substantial goodwill impairment charges totaling 781M USD in 2023, reflecting the decline in the company's market capitalization and challenges in certain segments.</li>
                          <li class="text-gray-700"><b>Liquidity and Debt:</b> While Tyson Foods maintains a reasonable level of liquidity, its debt levels have increased, and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA has risen significantly.</li>
